# minesweeper
This is a minesweeper game written using Pygame, a Python library. 
The mines are shown in purple and the uncovered squares are a certain color based on how many mines are around them. 
Teal = 0, Blue = 1, Tan = 2, Light Purple = 3, Orange = 4
The only bug is that squares count mines next to them if the mine wrapped around to the next column.
This makes the uncovered colors a little harder to decipher.
